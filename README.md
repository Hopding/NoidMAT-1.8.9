# NoidMAT-1.8.9
A Minecraft Forge Mod For Automating Minecraft

NoidMAT (Noid Minecraft Automation Tool) is an extensible Minecraft Forge mod designed to automate as much as possible of Minecraft's survival mode. Instructions on its installation and use can be found in the README for the current [release](https://github.com/Hopding/NoidMAT-1.8.9/releases/).

By default, NoidMAT is currently able to:
 * Build walls
 * Break down walls
 * Mine out areas
 * Walk, swim, and jump for long periods of time without requiring the user to hold the W, A, S, D keys or the spacebar.

Using NoidMAT is as simple as pressing the "X" key on your keyboard and entering a command, e.g.
```
BuildWall 5:5
```

Users can make their own tasks to be automated by NoidMAT by utilizing the NoidMAT API and writing some very simple java code. Details can be found in the README for the current [release](https://github.com/Hopding/NoidMAT-1.8.9/releases/).
