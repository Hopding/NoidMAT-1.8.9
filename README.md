# NoidMAT-1.8.9
A Minecraft Forge Mod For Automating Minecraft

NoidMAT (Noid Minecraft Automation Tool) is a Minecraft Forge mod designed to automate as much as possible in Minecraft's survival mode. Instructions on its installation and use can be found in the README for the current [release](https://github.com/Hopding/NoidMAT-1.8.9/releases/).

NoidMAT is currently able to:
 * Build walls
 * Break down walls
 * Mine out areas
 * Walk, swim, and jump for long periods of time without requiring the user to hold the W, A, S, D keys or the spacebar.

Using NoidMAT is as simple as pressing the "X" key on your keyboard and entering a command, e.g.
```
BuildWall 5:5
```
